# Sequence_Class_Project
Data Structure Assignment where I made a Sequence helper Class (Sequence2.h) and an Implementation of the Sequence Class. (Sequence2.cpp) The Seq_2.cxx file was not created by me. It was used to test my Sequence Class.

//1. The number of items in the sequence is in the member variable used.
//2. The actual items of the bag are stored in a partially filled array.
//	 The array is a dynamic array, pointed to by the member variable data.
//3. The size of the dynamic array is in the member variable capacity.
//4. For an empty sequence we do not care for the current_index. Once an item 
//	 is placed in the sequence that item's index is store in current_index. 
//	 Manipulating the current_index with the member functions
//	 allows you to insert, attach, or erase any item in the sequence while maintaing its order.
